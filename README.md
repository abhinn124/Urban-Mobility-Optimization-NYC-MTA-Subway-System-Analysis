# Urban Mobility Optimization: NYC MTA Subway System Analysis

## Project Introduction & Objectives

This project analyzes New York City's MTA subway system data to develop data-driven solutions for urban mobility optimization. We focus on three key objectives:

### 1. Ridership Forecasting
Develop predictive models for daily station usage by incorporating:
- Historical turnstile data patterns
- Weather conditions impact
- Day-of-week and seasonal variations
- Special event influences

### 2. Incident Impact Analysis
Examine how service disruptions affect the network:
- Quantify ridership changes during incidents
- Identify passenger flow redistribution patterns
- Measure recovery time after disruptions
- Analyze cascading effects on neighboring stations

### 3. Station Clustering & Pattern Recognition
Group stations based on:
- Usage patterns and peak hours
- Service line connectivity
- Incident vulnerability

## Expected Impact

This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for:
- Optimizing train frequencies based on predicted demand
- Improving incident response and alternative route planning
- Identifying critical stations for infrastructure improvements
- Reducing system-wide congestion through better resource allocation

By understanding these patterns, we can help MTA planners make data-driven decisions to enhance service reliability and passenger experience across New York City's subway network.
